### C Fundementals - Projects 2.05

Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for x and then displays the value of the following polynomial ```3x^5 + 2x^4 - 5x^3 -x^2 + 7x -6```

Hint: C doesn't have an exponentiation operator, so you'll need to multiple x by itself repeatedly in order to compute the powers of x. (For example, x * x * x is x cubed.)

### Solution

See ```05.c```
