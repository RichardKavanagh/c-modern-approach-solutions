### C Loops - Exercise 6.05

While one of the following statements is not equivelant to the other two (assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

```
(a) while (i < 10) { ... }
(b) for (; i < 10;) { ... }
(c) do { ... } while (i < 10);
```

### Solution

c is not equivelant, it is always going to run once regardless of the value of ```i```
