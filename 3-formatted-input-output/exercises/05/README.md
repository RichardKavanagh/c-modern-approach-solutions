### C Formatted Input/Output - Exercise 3.05

Suppose that we call scanf as follows:

```scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);```

If the user enters

```12.3 45.6 789```

what will be the values of ```x```, ```i``` and ```y``` after the call? (Assume that ```x``` and ```y``` are ```float``` variables and ```i``` is a ```int``` variable.)

### Solution

See 5.c for execution

12.30, 45 and 0.6
