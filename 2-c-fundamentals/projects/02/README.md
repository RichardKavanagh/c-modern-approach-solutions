### C Fundementals - Projects 2.02

Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a 10-meter radius, using formular ```V = (4/3)Ï€r^3```.
Write the fraction 4/3 as ```4.0f / 3.0f```. (Try writing it as 4 / 3. What happens?) Hint: C doesn't have an
exponentiation operator, so you'll need to multiply r by itself twice to compute ```r^3```.

### Solution

See 2.c

Writing the fraction in integer form will result in a integer rounding error, returning 1.
